This means overall attempt grade tends to be below average when the grade for this question is above average and vice-versa.

Our equation for effective question weight cannot be calculated in this case. The calculations for effective question weight for other questions in this quiz are the effective question weight for these questions if the highlighted questions with a negative covariance are given a maximum grade of zero.

If you edit a quiz and give these question(s) with negative covariance a max grade of zero then the effective question weight of these questions will be zero and the real effective question weight of other questions will be as calculated now.";s:17:"nostudentsingroup";s:39:"There are no students in this group yet";s:11:"optiongrade";s:14:"Partial credit";s:14:"partofquestion";s:16:"Part of question";s:10:"pluginname";s:10:"Statistics";s:8:"position";s:8:"Position";s:9:"positions";s:11:"Position(s)";s:19:"questioninformation";s:20:"Question information";s:12:"questionname";s:13:"Question name";s:14:"questionnumber";s:2:"Q#";s:18:"questionstatistics";s:19:"Question statistics";s:21:"questionstatsfilename";s:13:"questionstats";s:12:"questiontype";s:13:"Question type";s:15:"quizinformation";s:16:"Quiz information";s:8:"quizname";s:9:"Quiz name";s:21:"quizoverallstatistics";s:23:"Quiz overall statistics";s:21:"quizstructureanalysis";s:23:"Quiz structure analysis";s:18:"random_guess_score";s:18:"Random guess score";s:14:"recalculatenow";s:15:"Recalculate now";s:8:"response";s:8:"Response";s:8:"skewness";s:38:"Score distribution skewness (for {$a})";s:17:"standarddeviation";s:29:"Standard deviation (for {$a})";s:18:"standarddeviationq";s:18:"Standard deviation";s:13:"standarderror";s:25:"Standard error (for {$a})";s:10:"statistics";s:10:"Statistics";s:24:"statistics:componentname";s:22:"Quiz statistics report";s:16:"statisticsreport";s:17:"Statistics report";s:21:"statisticsreportgraph";s:33:"Statistics for question positions";s:15:"statistics:view";s:22:"View statistics report";s:8:"statsfor";s:26:"Quiz statistics (for {$a})";}
