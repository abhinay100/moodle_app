Enabling this will speed up file interactions but comes at the cost of increased risk of hitting file system limitations.<br />
It is advisable to only turn this on if the following is true:<br />
  - If you know the number of items in the cache is going to be small enough that it won't cause issues on the file system you are running with.<br />
  - The data being cached is not expensive to generate. If it is then sticking with the default may still be the better option as it reduces the chance of issues.";}
